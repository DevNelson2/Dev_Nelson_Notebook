## SDS-Page gels
*Recipe for 2 gels*

---
|Ingredients         | 12% Resolving gel |  4.5% Stacking gel |
|:---:| :---:| :---:|
|H20                 |8.7 ml             |  6.4ml
|40% Bis-Acryl       |6ml| 1.1ml|
|Buffer              | 5ml (1.5M Tris-HCl pH 8.8)|2.52ml (0.5 Tris-HCl pH 6.8)|
|10% SDS             |200ul| 100ul
|10% APS             |100ul|50ul
|TEMED               |10ul|10 ul

* Add TEMED last always
* Ensure glass is clean and there are no cracks
* Check for leakage before using (fill up glass and wait five minutes)
* Add layer at the bottom with 10X TEMED to prevent leaks

Let resolving gel sit for 30 minutes - 1 hour.  
Add isopropanol to cover top of gel, pour off after the resolving gel has solidified and then rinse with DI water and blot dry.  
Let the stacking gel sit for 25 min - 1 hour.

## Transfer to nitrocellulose paper

*image to be inserted*

-> 70V @ 1.5 hours  
-> Add methanol to 1X buffer when using nitrocellulose membranes  
-> Change ice every 45 minutes

Adjustments made to protocol:
* time adjustments: Over night @30V/0.09A (14 hours)
* PVDF membrane: no methanol in buffer, instead the membrane is pre soaked for 3-5 minutes

### Buffer recipe

| 1X | 10X|
|:---:|:---:|
|28.8 g glycine|288 g glycine|
|6.04 Tris base| 60.4 Tris base|
|200 ml methanol (Nitrocellulose only)| No methanol|
|1.6 L ddH20| 1.8 L dd H20|


10X --> 1X = 1--ml 10X + 100ml methanol + 800ml ddH20  
* No methanol for PVDF buffer - soak instead

### Western Blot recipe

#### 10x TBS recipe:  
* 24 g Tris base
* 88 g NaCl
--> Dissolve in 900ml dH20  
--> Adjust pH to 7.6 with 12 N HCl  
--> Adjust final volume to 1L


#### TBST recipe:

* 100 ml 10X TBS
* 900 ml dH20
* 1ml tween 20

-----
#### Western blot protocol
1. rotate membrane 1 time with TBS - 5 minutes
2. Prep blocking agent (2.5 g nonfat milk + 50ml TBS, vortex)
3. Remove TBS, add enough blocking agent to cover membrane
4. Rotate 15 min - 1 hr
5. Apply primary antibodies, rotate at 4C overnight
6. Wash membrane with TBST 3 times 5-10 minutes each
7. Apply secondary antibodies, rotate at room temp for 1.5 hours
8. Recover antibodies
9. Wash membrane with TBST 2 times for 5 minutes each
10. Wash 1 time with TBS


Imaging settings Fuji301 ECL:  
Tray 2, chemoluminescence
    increment and precision mode, time depends on membrane

### Stripping membrane


Mild Recipe
* 15 g glycine
* 1 g SDS
* 10 ml tween
* 800ml H20  
--> adjust pH to 2.2

Steps:
1. Rotate 10 minutes with strip Buffer
2. Discard and repeat 2X
3. Rotate with PBS 10 min (2X)
4. Rotate with TBST 5 min (2X)

### Staining recipes - Ponceau S and Coomassie

Ponceau S recipe: | Coomassie recipe
0.5 g Ponceau S| 450ml methanol
25ml acetic acid| 300ml acetic acid
400ml H20 |   1 g coomasie brilliant blue
   | Water to 1L

Ponceau S staining:  
* Stain before blocking
* Rotate 10 min
* Rinse with water 2-3X after for 30 seconds
* Rinse with TBS to remove completely
* Ponceau S is reusable

Coomassie staining:
* Stain 1 hour
* destain 2 hours
