## First run of Western Blotting with Seahorse serum.
---
#### Purpose:
The first step in analyzing hybridomas. Used SH41 serum and hybridoma with strong ELIZA result to asses if results show on WB
Testing reducing and non reducing condition as well as fractionated samples.

#### Experiment set up:


Gel 1:

Protocol:
1. ran protocol according to [recipes](https://devnelson2.github.io/Dev_Nelson_Notebook/recipes/)  
In brief: 12% resolving gel and 4% stacking gel using 40% Bis-Acryl, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane
    * no methanol added  
gel ran 15 min @ 70 + 1 hour @ 120, Transfer occurred at 70V for 1.5 hours. Imaging time and antibody dilutions not recorded (TW41 was used)

2. gel # 2 coomassie
3. Gel # 1 cut into strips for WB

#### Results

#### Notes


Had leakage out of wells during pipetting.  

Results of WB show lines across reduced and not reduced at the same level, a possible reason is spillover.  
No results for E6E7, unclear why.
